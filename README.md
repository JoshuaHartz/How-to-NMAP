# How-to-NMAP

[NMAP](https://nmap.org/download.html) is a free to use network security scanner availiable for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

## How to Download

I'll be going over how to download Nmap on Windows and Linux. 

### Windows

Install [here](https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.94-setup.exe) 

This installation is a GUI based version of Nmap. 

Once you start the installation via the wizard, click continue and allow when needed.

Once finished downloading type nmap in the windows search bar and run. You will be met with this.
